# Deep learning

## Neural networks

### Neurons

- Inputs / output
- Weights
- Bias
- Activation function
- Neuron computation as matrix multiplications

### Neuron Layers

- Neural network: set of connected neurons
- Concept of layers
- Input, hidden and output layers

### Logical gate neural networks

- AND gate
- OR gate
- XOR gate

## Training algorithms

### Gradient descent

- Concept of using the derivative to find a local minima of a function
- Example of linear regression
- Concept of backpropagation

### Learning rate

- Concept of learning rate
- Learning rate tuning via cyclical learning rate

### Convolution layers

- Definition of convolution
- Example of convolution
- Convolutions are a way to focus the network computations on spatial
  informations
- Explanation of how convolution kernels are modified by gradient
  descent
